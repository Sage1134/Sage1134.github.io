                <div class="anecdote-content">
                    <p>
                        I am excited about the opportunity to serve as next year's Mentor president. What sets me apart from the other candidates is my ability to assess a
                        situation, adapt to it and plan accordingly. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout high school, I have always wanted to pursue computer science as my post-secondary. I was told by my family “Get work experience! Get a Computer
                        Sience Internship! That will give you a head start and set you apart from the rest”. So I tried, I tried to find an opportunity; disappointingly, I found
                        that it is incredibly rare for a computer science position to be open to a high school student. My friends encouraged me, “Build connections! Get a Computer
                        Science Internship!” they said. So I tried, I tried to build connections; Unfortunately strong connections were hard to come by. Then one day, I was struck
                        with an idea: Adapt to the circumstances and create an opportunity myself. With determination, I founded a summer code camp, ByteQuest Academy. Despite the
                        limited opportunities provided to high school students in the computer science industry, I managed to adapt and create an opportunity, an opportunity that
                        allows me to build up aspiring computer scientists in the world of computer science.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My initiative, ByteQuest Academy, also exemplifies the other characteristics of a good mentor president: leadership, communication, organization, empathy,
                        commitment, vision and effective role modeling. Organizing this initiative requires significant leadership abilities, as I manage the overall operations of
                        the camp. Communication is crucial for the camp, as I work with my volunteers and participants to ensure they understand the material and feel supported.
                        Additionally, organization is a major aspect of the initiative, as I create lesson plans and schedules, and manage camp logistics. Empathy plays a vital
                        role in my ability to understand the diverse backgrounds and learning paces of participants, allowing me to fine-tune the lessons, to meet everyone's needs.
                        My commitment to the camp is demonstrated through the hours spent working towards my vision for the camp: to provide free coding lessons to aspiring computer
                        scientists. Throughout the entire initiative, I take on the position of a role model for both my volunteers and camp participants.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My experience with ByteQuest Academy is one of my many experiences that exemplifies the qualities that make me an ideal mentor president. I plan
                        to bring the same dedication and commitment I have from ByteQuest Academy to Mentors.
